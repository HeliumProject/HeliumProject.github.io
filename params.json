{"name":"Helium Project","tagline":"Open Source Frameworks and Game Engine","body":"### Welcome to Helium Project\r\n\r\nHelium is a set of open-source cross-platform C++ Frameworks, and it aspires to be a high performance Game Engine.  It is permissively licensed under a BSD-style license.\r\n\r\n### Stable Frameworks\r\n\r\n[Platform](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Platform) is a simple platform abstraction layer that works on Windows, OSX, and Linux.  It provides a thin abstraction layer to file i/o, threads, synchronization primitives, and address space allocation.\r\n\r\n[Foundation](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Foundation) is a set of C++ containers, interprocess communication, reference counting, and language utilities like events and delegates.\r\n\r\n[Reflect](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Reflect) is an implementation of C++ reflection that provides metadata that can help automate many rote programming tasks.\r\n\r\n[Persist](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Persist) is an implementation of object persistence that utilizes C++ reflection.  It currently supports JSON and BSON, and it can handle both data within an object as well as relationships between objects (potentially stored in separate files).\r\n\r\n[Mongo](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Mongo) is an implementation of the database object model pattern that uses C++ reflection for marshaling object data to and from mongodb's BSON format.\r\n\r\n### Game Engine\r\n\r\nRight now the Game Engine is under heavy development.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

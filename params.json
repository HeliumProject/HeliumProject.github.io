It is permissively licensed under a BSD-style license.\r\n\r\n### Stable Frameworks\r\n\r\n[Platform](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Platform) is a simple platform abstraction layer that works on Windows, OSX, and Linux.\r\n\r\n[Foundation](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Foundation) is a typical set of container classes, as well as interprocess communication, and some language extensions like events and delegates.\r\n\r\n[Reflect](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Reflect) is an implementation of C++ reflection that provides metadata that automates many rote programming tasks.\r\n\r\n[Persist](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Persist) is an implementation of object persistence that utilizes C++ reflection.  It currently supports JSON and BSON.\r\n\r\n[Mongo](https://github.com/HeliumProject/Mongo) is an implementation of a database object model that uses C++ reflection for marshaling object data to and from mongodb's BSON format.\r\n\r\n### Game Engine\r\n\r\nRight now the Game Engine is under heavy development.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
